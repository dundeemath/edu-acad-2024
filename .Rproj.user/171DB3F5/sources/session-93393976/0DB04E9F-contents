## Mathematics at Dundee

## Evidence of Positive Practice

## Bias vs Variation

## Age Guessing: group task \[10 min\]

-   Ten cards display a photo of a person unknown to you. These cards will be passed around from group to group.
-   For each card:
    -   Estimate the age of the person in the photo in whole years; your group must come up with a single estimate.
    -   Record your estimate in the attached table.
-   Please select one person to report your groupâ€™s estimates.

## Test

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 520

library(shiny)
library(bslib)

# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----
ui <- page_sidebar(

  # App title ----
  title = "Hello Shiny!",

  # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
  sidebar = sidebar(

    # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
    sliderInput(
      inputId = "bins",
      label = "Number of bins:",
      min = 1,
      max = 50,
      value = 30
    )
  ),

  # Output: Histogram ----
  plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server <- function(input, output) {

  # Histogram of the Old Faithful Geyser Data ----
  # with requested number of bins
  # This expression that generates a histogram is wrapped in a call
  # to renderPlot to indicate that:
  #
  # 1. It is "reactive" and therefore should be automatically
  #    re-executed when inputs (input$bins) change
  # 2. Its output type is a plot
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x <- faithful$waiting
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    hist(
      x,
      breaks = bins,
      col = "#75AADB",
      border = "white",
      xlab = "Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)",
      main = "Histogram of waiting times"
    )
  })
}

# Create Shiny app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
